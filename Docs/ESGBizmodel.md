# ESG Framework & Business Model for ONE-JAZ (Jaza Miti Initiative)

**Environmental, Social, and Governance Strategy for Sustainable Tree Planting at Scale**

---

## Executive Summary

ONE-JAZ represents a comprehensive ESG-driven platform that transforms Kenya's Jaza Miti tree-planting initiative into a sustainable, economically viable ecosystem. By integrating blockchain technology, gamification, and carbon market mechanisms, the platform creates a multi-stakeholder value chain that addresses climate action (SDG 13), sustainable communities (SDG 11), and economic opportunity (SDG 8) simultaneously.

This document outlines the ESG framework, economic model, and business strategy for achieving financial sustainability while delivering measurable environmental and social impact. The model is designed to attract impact investors, corporate sustainability partners, development finance institutions, and carbon credit buyers while ensuring long-term viability and community empowerment.

**Key ESG Metrics (Year 1 Targets)**
- **Environmental**: 5 million trees verified, 250,000 metric tons CO₂ sequestered
- **Social**: 100,000 active participants, $2.5M distributed to communities, 40% youth/women engagement
- **Governance**: 35% DAO voting participation, 100% transparent on-chain transactions

**Economic Model**: Revenue generated through carbon credits (60%), transaction fees (15%), corporate partnerships (20%), and grants (5%), achieving break-even in Year 2 with projected $1.2M+ annual revenue by Year 3.

10.2 Technology Architecture
Core Stack:

Blockchain: OneChain (for primary transactions, token issuance, and governance), with Hedera Consensus Service for immutable, low-carbon timestamping of verification data.

Smart Contracts: Written in Solidity (EVM-compatible) for token distribution, staking, and DAO voting.

Off-Chain Verification Oracle: A decentralized network of nodes that aggregates data from validators, AI analysis, and satellite feeds before committing a verified hash to the blockchain.

Mobile App: React Native (iOS/Android) for tree submission, wallet management, and gamified learning.

Backend & AI: Python/Django for the core platform; TensorFlow for image recognition models; GIS integration for mapping.

Key Technical Features:

Decentralized Identity (DID): Users control their identity and data, enabling portability of their impact record.

Verifiable Credentials (VCs): For representing certified carbon credits and NFT trees as standardized, tradeable digital assets.

IPFS/Arweave: For storing immutable image and geolocation data from tree submissions, ensuring long-term verifiability.

API Gateway: Robust set of public APIs for partners, researchers, and corporate clients to access verified impact data.

11. Conclusion & Summary
The ONE-JAZ business model presents a transformative approach to environmental restoration by aligning economic incentives with ecological and social impact. It moves beyond traditional charity-based tree planting by creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where every stakeholder—from the smallholder farmer to the multinational corporation—receives tangible value.

Core Innovations:

Monetizing Trust: By using blockchain for transparent, immutable verification, ONE-JAZ converts tree planting from an act of goodwill into a verifiable, monetizable environmental asset.

Community at the Core: The model is designed to ensure the majority of financial value flows back to the communities on the front lines of climate change, creating a powerful engine for rural economic development.

Gamified Scale: Leveraging behavioral economics and gamification, it solves the critical challenge of achieving and sustaining mass participation at a low cost.

Market-Based Sustainability: The reliance on carbon credits and corporate partnerships, rather than perpetual grants, creates a durable, scalable funding model that grows with its impact.

Investment Readiness: This framework demonstrates a clear path to market, profitability, and significant scale. The initial $500K seed funding will catalyze the pilot, de-risking the technology and community engagement model for subsequent larger rounds. The strong alignment with global ESG trends, Kenya's national climate goals, and the burgeoning voluntary carbon market positions ONE-JAZ for exceptional financial and impact returns.

Call to Action: ONE-JAZ is more than a business; it is a blueprint for how we can collectively address the climate crisis by harnessing technology, community, and markets. We invite impact investors, strategic corporate partners, and government collaborators to join us in building this scalable solution for a greener, more prosperous future.
